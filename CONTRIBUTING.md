## Local development

1. Build the server:
```bash
pnpm build
```

> Note: You need to run the generate command before building.

2. Start the server:
```bash
pnpm start
```

This will start the server at `http://localhost:3001`


### Environment Variables

The server uses dotenv for configuration. Create a `.env` file in your project root with the necessary environment variables.
